# Overview

# Philosophy

# Gentoo installation
The starting point for this rice is obviously the clean installation of Gentoo Linux on your machine. I've used the [Gentoo wiki](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:AMD64#Installing_Gentoo) (I'm assuming you're using an AMD64 architecture) and a couple of Youtube videos to guide me, but I won't show you how to do it here, believe me the Gentoo Wiki documentation is the best there is, take advantage of it and use it.
