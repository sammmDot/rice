# Gentoo rice
Welcome to the repository of my rice and configurations for gentoo, if you need me to answer a question or something more specific, you can contact me, if you want to contribute with some improvement to the code you can also do it.

## Philosophy
Let me explain why we are here. For a long time I've been dreaming of a system; minimalist, ultra-customizable, highly flexible, powerful, and that doesn't consume like a fucking glutton the resources of your system. I think; “If you don't use that software, why are you going to have it on your machine?”, I hate those dependencies and that pre-installed software that you will never end up using and that on top of that is costing you resources, you will say “Bro, it's only 1% of it”, believe me my friend 1% makes the difference between an optimized system and one that doesn't take advantage of its full potential.

### Why Gentoo?  
#### Advantages
At the beginning of all this I investigated what was going to be the heart of this project, at the end I came to two options; Gentoo or Arch, I decided for Gentoo. My decision was based on extensive research, I came to the conclusion that Gentoo is much more customizable than ArchLinux, the latter is known for its ultra minimalism and its philosophy of KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid), but it did not exceed the range of possibilities offered by Gentoo. I loved that already from the initial configuration and the first installation it offered you to modify kernel modules to better adapt to our requirements, not as in arch that offers you its minimalist and vanilla configuration of it. Gentoo developers encourage us to compile our own kernel, giving us the opportunity to understand and fine-tune the kernel configuration of our system.

#### Documentation
In the field of documentation in Gentoo, this is much more produced than the ArchLinux installation guide manual, which leaves much to be desired, and we all agree that the ArchWiki is super complete, so I'm surprised that your installation guide manual is so poor, besides there are already a lot of videos on youtube that explain it. Gentoo and its developers don't skimp on providing you not only with the default alternative, but also offer you alternate alternatives, and I would even say that they encourage you to take the hard way rather than the easy and default way.

#### Is compiling boring?
bro, use a binary and that's it, I may be very “”“”“”eccentric“”“”” but I love my time. Shut the f*ck up purist, if you want to spend 5 hours compiling Firefox is your problem.

#### Init system
If you are a lover of the UNIX philosophy, don't worry, due to the flexibility of Gentoo, several init systems are available. Don't force yourself to use _systemd_ and take control of your system.
